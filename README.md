# BudgetTracker

This is a very simple but useful budget tracker, that I created to track my own personal finances.

This Script takes my bank transaction history in CSV files as input.
Then parses through the data and establish variables like Date, Amount, Account Type, Category, and Description.

I will be adding a feature that will work with Google Sheets API to be able to load the transaction data into a google spreadsheet.
